      <p class="lead">Written by <strong>Daughter of Balochistan</strong></p>

      <p>It was a cold evening in Quetta, November’s dim light spreading through every corner of the city. On 30<sup>th</sup> November 2018, in a quiet corner of the city, an ordinary house was immersed in its usual calm. Soft light filled the room, books lay neatly on the table, and everything was in its place.</p>

      <p>Suddenly, the door burst open, and in an instant, a team of officials stormed inside. Fifteen-year-old Hussnain froze in shock and fear. The officers’ entry, the echo of their footsteps, the clatter as they pushed things around the room—all of it multiplied the intensity of the moment. His mother’s screams and cries reverberated through every corner. Fear, panic, and helplessness for her loved ones were etched clearly on her face.</p>

      <p>The officials turned the house upside down, scattering items across the floor, leaving boot marks on the carpets. Every step, every shove, every movement heightened the terror. The small heart of Hussnain raced uncontrollably. Every sound, every scene stirred turmoil inside him. At that moment, it felt as though time itself had stopped, and everything—the movements, the rooms, the house—had been swallowed by shadows of fear. In just a few moments, the atmosphere of the house changed. Silence and emptiness enveloped every room because the officials had taken Hussnain, his older brother, and his father with them. After their departure, the house was left empty, desolate, and only his mother’s sobs remained.</p>

      <p>A few days later, Hussnain’s father was released, and after a few months, his elder brother, Chairman Jihad Baloch, also regained freedom. But Hussnain was now in some unknown location. Those months had completely changed his mother. The beautiful woman, who once radiated light with her smile and grace, slowly aged within those few months. Fatigue in her eyes, restlessness on her face, and quiet pain became her constant companions. Rumors spread across the city—why was this child taken? What was he involved in? False news, people’s indifference, and gossip—everything was nothing but noise. I have seen many disappearances in my life, but Hussnain’s disappearance felt different. He was just a high-school student, an innocent and quiet child. What had happened to him? Such disappearances might seem ordinary, but they leave a deep mark on the soul. They change the life of a family, turn siblings’ worlds upside down, and fill every day with fear, anticipation, and uncertainty.</p>

      <h2>A Pattern Written in Silence</h2>

      <p>This was not a single incident. Across Balochistan, thousands of disappearances echo in the silence of history. From a philosophical perspective, this is an extreme form of the “Negation of Existence,” where the physical absence of an individual affects their human dignity and social survival. History in Europe offers similar examples: military dictatorships in South America, political imprisonment in Nazi Germany, or Franco’s military operations in Spain, where people were forcibly disappeared and societies were held captive by fear. Even in those historical instances, stories of human struggle and resistance remain hidden, but every disappearance leaves a permanent mark on the family, community, and collective consciousness.</p>

      <p>The same reality exists in Balochistan. Every abducted child, every disappeared individual, not only changes the life of a family but also creates a complete societal void. In the echo of fear, suspicion, and rumors, the innocence of a generation is suppressed. And in every family’s story, there lies a philosophy intertwined with human dignity, freedom, and the fundamental principles of moral struggle.</p>

      <h2>Seven Years Without a Sunrise</h2>

      <p>November 13<sup>th</sup> was Hussnain’s birthday. Now, he has turned 23. Perhaps he has long lost count of the years, for he has been moved to a prison where day and night merge into the same color. A place where solitary confinement tears a person apart from within. Psychologists say that prolonged imprisonment and isolation gradually deteriorate the nerves, and one begins talking to oneself. But the most remarkable thing about Hussnain is his courage. I will not recall the seven years he endured, nor the torment he suffered, nor the time he spent away from his home and family. One thing remains clear—he is brave. Unbreakable.</p>

      <p>Seven years have passed since 2018. I am weak in mathematics, but even I understand that seven days can change a person, let alone seven years. Perhaps he is no longer the fifteen-year-old boy; perhaps he has become a dignified and resilient man. Perhaps his back is weary, but he has not surrendered. They say torment and isolation physically and mentally break a person, paralyzing the nerves, yet he is still alive. He still requests books. Yes, books. He wants to read. That stubbornness, that desire—this is the proof that he is alive.</p>

      <blockquote>Neuroscientists say that such torment severely affects the nervous system, yet Hussnain continues to fight alongside his own existence.</blockquote>

      <p>And when I think about him, only one question remains in my mind: Why is he so brave? He has choices. He could bow down, comply, and gain his freedom. But he does not. He could do as they say, perhaps be released the next day. Yet he refuses. Why? Why does he not sell his land for his freedom?</p>

      <p>If ever I get the chance to meet him again, there is only one question I would ask:</p>

      <blockquote>How did you survive in those dark cells?<br>Why didn’t you give up?</blockquote>
